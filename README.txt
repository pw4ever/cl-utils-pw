* Philosophy
This collection of Common Lisp utilities abstract common tasks of the maintainer(s). It is *not* not meant to be self-contained in the sense that established Common Lisp libraries such as Alexandria, Swank, and so on are used liberally (but nevertheless declared as ASDF dependencies in the ".asd" file).
